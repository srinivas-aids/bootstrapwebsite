            <div class="h3 bg-secondary" style="height:1000px;">The Government of India vied Resolution No.8/136/68-PI (Pers.) dated 28.08.1970 formally
                established the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), under the Ministry of Home
                Affairs giving a new orientation to then existing Police Research and Advisory Council (1966) for the
                following reasons and with the primary objective of modernization of police force: Training is a vital
                and growing requirement to improve the competency of police forces in the country. The
                Gore-Committee (1971) set up by the Government of India studied the train√≠ng aspects of police and
                gave several recommendations. The government of India in accepting its recommendations created
                a Training Division (1973) in addition to the two divisions already existing to function under the
                Bureau.The forensic science services uncompromising & Geese under the Development Division
                grew over a period and a separate Directorate of Forensic Sciences under the BPR&D came into
                existence in 1983.
                Further in 1995 Government of India decided to entrust issues relating to Correctional
                Administration Work to the BPR&D so that problems relating to prisons and implementation of
                deemed prison reforms can be taken up by the Bureau in a cohesive manner. This set up is operating
                out of the existing manpower resources.
                During the year 2008, the Government of India further decided to create National Police Mission
                under the administrative control of BPR&D to transform the police forces in the country into
                effective instrument for maintenance of internal security and facing the challenges in future, by
                equipping them with the necessary material, intellectual and organizational resources.
